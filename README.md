# Dakia: A cloud native API Gateway

**Dakia** is a cloud native API Gateway designed with developers experience in mind, offering a fully configurable, extensible and programmable network solution. **Dakia** enabling developers to customize and tailor the gateway to fit their unique needs...

> It's under construction 🦺 🪚 🏗️ 🚧 🔨

## Feature highlights

- **Configurable**: Easily manage API configurations using various formats like YAML, JSON, and HTTP API calls.
- **Extensible**: Add new functionality with support for custom middleware and plugins, written in any programming language (Rust, Java, C++, etc.).
- **Fully Programmable**: Tailor the API Gateway to your specific needs with custom plugins and middleware in multiple languages.
- **Zero Downtime Upgrades**: Perform upgrades and restarts without affecting the availability of your services.
- **Dynamic Middleware**: Add, remove, or modify middleware on the fly without disrupting service.
- **Request and Response Management**: Modify requests before they reach the upstream or read/write responses to meet your application's needs.
- **Real-Time Configuration**: Modify your gateway configuration in real time with no downtime, using HTTP API calls.

Dakia ensures your services stay performant, reliable, and highly customizable, giving you full control.

## Limitations ☠️

> These limitations will be addressed over time as we continue to improve the dakia.

- Currently supports only `UTF-8` character encoding.
- Only the round-robin load balancing algorithm is available at the moment.
- IPv6 addresses are not supported at this time; only IPv4 is supported.
- Currently it supports only `HTTP` protocol

## Reasons to use `Dakia`

- **Security** - Built with Rust, Dakia ensures enhanced memory safety and reduces vulnerabilities compared to services written in C/C++.
- **Performance** - Powered by [pingora](https://github.com/cloudflare/pingora), a battle tested protocol implemention, as it has been serving more than **_40M+_** internet requests per second for more than a few years.
- **Customization** - You need ultimate customization, you can configure, extend and even further program in multiple languages.
- **Asynchronous and Multi-Threaded** – Dakia is designed to handle tasks concurrently, ensuring efficient and high-performance request processing by default.
